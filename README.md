> The Plant-N-Go is an automatic sensor system that detects soil moisture, light level, air humidity, and room temperature. This system can be activated when you leave your home and will water your plants as needed while you are away. It will also control room lighting as needed to maximize plant growth while minimizing energy consumption. The data is then sent to a website that can be viewed while traveling. This system uses an <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021">Arduino UNO</a>, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/161">photoresistors</a>, an <A href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/focus-display-solutions,-inc./C162A-BW-LW65/13901792?utm_adgroup=Focus%20Display%20Solutions%2C%20INC.&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Shopping_DK%2BSupplier_Tier%201%20-%20Block%201&utm_term=&utm_content=Focus%20Display%20Solutions%2C%20INC.&gclid=Cj0KCQiAofieBhDXARIsAHTTldrfnxbEcoGekpcT930UTO1mDOkypcnqVV6L7zwSmPSZFhBcvRuWWNkaAtKLEALw_wcB">LCD</a>, a <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/universal-solder-electronics-ltd/DHT11/16822119?utm_adgroup=UNIVERSAL-SOLDER%20ELECTRONICS%20LTD&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Shopping_DK%2BSupplier_Tier%202%20-%20Block%203&utm_term=&utm_content=UNIVERSAL-SOLDER%20ELECTRONICS%20LTD&gclid=Cj0KCQiAofieBhDXARIsAHTTldpzbkvznooU4HisU8D9rFRqHQkVpB6gxFqMmvJdwaNrI4H6Xck2veUaAqHXEALw_wcB">humidity and temperature sensor</a>, and a <a href="https://www.circuitspecialists.com/products/mot-3">DC Motor</a>.
